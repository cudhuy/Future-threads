# FutureThreads
FutureThreads is a futuristic simulation game where players make policy decisions each year.

- These choices directly impact:

- The balance of power

- Public trust in the government

- The state of the environment

If the player fails to manage these elements effectively, the game endsâ€”representing a failed policy strategy.

The goal is to give players a deeper understanding of how complex policy-making can be, the ripple effects of decisions, and the challenge of maintaining long-term stability.
