# title
# description
# image - a url of the image being used
# source - a link to a source of the info if one exists
# optimism - value from 0-1 where 0 is worst case and 1 is best case
# dateRange - 2 dates for earliest possible year (optimism of 1), latest possible year (optimism of 0)
# relevance - value 0-1 where 1 is very important and 0 is not at all important
# isPositive - boolean for if the change is good or bad
# tags - a list of tags that this falls under

### optimism reference
# 0.0 - The world ends in the next few years
# 0.1 - The world ends in the next few hundred years
# 0.2 - The world doesnt end, but gets very dystopian
# 0.3 - stuf goes quite bad, but not quite dystopia
# 0.4 - General Downwards trend, but no world ending
# 0.5 - Quality of life stays about the same
# 0.6 - Mild upwards trend, generally moving towards higher optimism bands
# 0.7 - Strong upwards trend in quality of life
# 0.8 - All world ending threats removed, e.g. climate change, war
# 0.9 - World peace, any other large scale issues solved, diseases almost all cured
# 1.0 - World enters a Utopia, all diseases cured, pain no longer exists for any living being

### relevance reference
# 0.0 -
# 0.1 -
# 0.2 -
# 0.3 -
# 0.4 - An entire country aware of this, e.g. small discovery, or election
# 0.5 - 20% humans aware of this, e.g. somewhat large discovery, but not life changing, like photo of black hole
# 0.6 - 50% of humans aware of this, e.g. big discovery science advancement, mars colony
# 0.7 - most (80%) humans would be aware of this, large effect to the relevant community,
# 0.8 - all humans would be aware of this, some, e.g. 1 country greatly effected, e.g. large scale war between 2 countries like russia/ukraine
# 0.9 - all humans are somewhat effected, e.g. world war
# 1.0 - huge effect to all humanity, e.g. nuclear war
